‚öôÔ∏è **Maintenance and resilience upgrades ‚Äî a cleaner deck, steadier sails, and sharper command discipline**

Tradebot v1.0.8 focuses on **robustness, data consistency, and operational hygiene**.  
It tightens internal bookkeeping, prevents duplicate reconciliations, and adds self-checks to ensure the fleet remains seaworthy through long voyages.
Also introducing a smarter BLEND mechanism.
Instead of small, barely visible float adjustments, the tuner now applies quantized, weighted, and bounded moves toward the prevailing market regime.

---

## ‚öì The Fleet Metaphor
To make the strategy easier to visualize:

- **EMA ‚Üí Captain**  
  The EMA crossover is the leader and core signal engine. When the short EMA crosses the long EMA, the Captain gives the order.

- **AutoTune ‚Üí Navigator**  
  The Navigator studies recent tides ‚Äî analyzing market ‚Äúweather‚Äù to recalibrate course.  
  When the seas are calm (choppy), it tightens risk controls; when trending, it opens the sails for broader moves.  
  AutoTune dynamically adjusts parameters like EMA confirmation count, RSI thresholds, and MACD bands based on regime votes (uptrend, downtrend, choppy, or blend).

- **MACD ‚Üí Commodore**  
  The Commodore confirms momentum and trend direction. If the histogram disagrees, the Captain‚Äôs signal can be overridden.

- **RSI ‚Üí Skipper**  
  The Skipper keeps things safe in the short term. If RSI shows overbought/oversold, trades are vetoed even if the Captain/Commodore want action.
  
- **Quartermaster ‚Üí Take-Profit & Stagnation Officer**  
  The Quartermaster safeguards the fleet‚Äôs earnings and tidiness.  
  - **Take-Profit (8%+)**: When profits reach a safe margin, the Quartermaster locks the cargo and sends the ship home ‚Äî a quick market exit.  

- **Deckhand (36 h, ¬±2%)**: The ‚Äúbroom‚Äù that sweeps idle trades off the deck when they drift aimlessly without momentum, keeping the decks lean and ready for action.
  This ensures capital is recycled efficiently while the Captain (EMA) and Advisors (RSI/MACD) focus on live opportunities.

- **Swab ‚Üí Deck Maintenance & Logkeeper** The newest crew member in v1.0.8 ‚Äî responsible for keeping the decks spotless and logs consistent. Handles processed fill pruning and record hygiene to prevent bloat.
(*Fun fact:* The term ‚ÄúSwab‚Äù was inspired by *Captain Ron* ‚Äî because every good ship needs a swab.)

Together they form a chain of command:
**EMA (Captain)** gives orders -> **AutoTune (Navigator)** continuously adjusts the fleet‚Äôs heading based on market weather -> **MACD (Commodore)** ensures strategy aligns with the broader trend -> **RSI (Skipper)** vetoes reckless moves -> **Quartermaster** secures profits and clears stagnation -> **Deckhand** keeps the decks clear of idle trades, ensuring the fleet stays agile and battle-ready -> **Swab** ensures no duplicate fills, stale positions, or misaligned logs remain aboard.

## ‚ú® v1.0.9 Highlights

- **Graceful shutdown everywhere:**  
  Unified cleanup for `Ctrl+C`, `SIGTERM`, and uncaught exceptions. Windows also supports `Ctrl+Break` (`SIGBREAK`).
- **Optional elapsed AutoTune refresh:**  
  One-shot retune after N hours that reuses the live REST client for consistent previews and lower rate-limit impact.
- **Disciplined startup order:**  
  **Reconcile ‚Üí AutoTune ‚Üí Websocket** so offsets and telemetry are correct from the start.
- **Denser telemetry block:**  
  Regime votes, per-product offsets, and advisory ‚Äúwould disable‚Äù candidates are logged together for quick review.
- **More responsive background reconcile:**  
  Short sleep steps keep shutdown snappy even mid-interval.
- **Hardened error paths:**  
  Clean exit if bot construction or websocket open fails, with clear diagnostics.

### Upgrade notes

- **Breaking (CSV):** `trades.csv` schema expanded (fees, realized P&L, quote spend/proceeds, order reason, base_increment, min_market_base_size, shave). Legacy CSVs require migration; sort is now **execution time, newest first**.
- **State:** `.state/portfolio.json` remains compatible; old phantom positions are auto-cleaned.
- **AutoTune:** Knob changes are quantized/weighted per regime with per-knob learning rates.
- **Startup order:** Reconcile ‚Üí AutoTune ‚Üí Websocket (ensures offsets/telemetry are correct).
- Adjusted autotune function. Each vote adjusts knobs by up to 2 bps, rounded to 0.5 bps, with per-knob learning rates for smooth adaptation.
- The golden choppy preset remains the bot‚Äôs stable baseline.

## Risk controls

- **Daily BUY cap**: limits the number of BUYs per day to curb overtrading during chop. Logged as  
  `**********Daily BUY cap reached (N). Skipping further BUYs.**********`
- **Quartermaster**: take-profit and stagnation exits; respects `base_increment` and `min_market_base_size`.
- **Exits**: `MARKET_ONLY` by default for deterministic fills under stress.
