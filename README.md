üöÄ **Refinements & smarter regime handling**

Tradebot is an automated crypto trading bot for **Coinbase Advanced**.  
It uses an **EMA crossover** strategy with **RSI/MACD advisors**, plus risk controls like daily caps, cooldowns, and optional stop-loss tolerance.  
By default, it now runs on **candle closes** (5-minute interval, `confirm_candles=3`).

---

## ‚öì The Fleet Metaphor
To make the strategy easier to visualize:

- **EMA ‚Üí Captain**  
  The EMA crossover is the leader and core signal engine. When the short EMA crosses the long EMA, the Captain gives the order.

- **MACD ‚Üí Commodore**  
  The Commodore confirms momentum and trend direction. If the histogram disagrees, the Captain‚Äôs signal can be overridden.

- **RSI ‚Üí Skipper**  
  The Skipper keeps things safe in the short term. If RSI shows overbought/oversold, trades are vetoed even if the Captain/Commodore want action.

Together, they form a chain of command: **EMA (Captain)** gives orders, **MACD (Commodore)** ensures strategy aligns with trend, and **RSI (Skipper)** vetoes reckless moves.

## ‚ú® v1.0.5 Highlights
- **Hybrid AutoTune regimes (new):**
  - Snap to strict regime if ‚â•70% vote share.
  - Blend winner ‚Üî Choppy if 55‚Äì69% (only sensitivity knobs).
  - Force Choppy if <55%.
- **Blended clamps** keep values safe while interpolating.
- **Enhanced logging:**
  - Mode (SNAP / BLEND / CHOPPY), vote shares, blend alpha, and global changes printed clearly.
  - Advisory-only ‚Äúwould disable‚Äù products (telemetry only).
  - Per-product offsets visible after 3-day KPI nudges.
- **No changes to indicator periods** (RSI/MACD structure stays fixed).
- **Offsets and floors:** still adaptive ¬±1 bps per coin, majors protected with lower floors.

---

### Upgrade notes
- You‚Äôll now see **BLEND** logs when the market is ambiguous (55‚Äì69% votes).  
  Example:  
  - Everything else (bot loop, safety rails, telemetry-only disables) remains unchanged.
  - Removed final reconcile to avoid redundancy. A fresh reconcile is done on each run.
