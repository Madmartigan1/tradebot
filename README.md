🚀 **Refinements & stability improvements**

Tradebot is an automated crypto trading bot for **Coinbase Advanced**.  
It uses an **EMA crossover** strategy with **RSI/MACD advisors**, plus risk controls like daily caps, cooldowns, and optional stop-loss tolerance.  
By default, it now runs on **candle closes** (5-minute interval, `confirm_candles=3`).

## ✨ v1.0.3 Highlights
- Refined **maker-limit logic**: prices rounded consistently to Coinbase increments
- **Repricing controls** for unfilled maker orders (`reprice_each_candle`, `max_reprices_per_signal`, etc.)
- **KPI CSV logging expanded**: now includes slippage (abs & bps) and hold time
- **Risk & advisors tweaked**: daily BUY cap $160, RSI defaults 60/40, MACD Â±3 bps
- **EMA deadband**: 8 bps neutral zone to reduce false crossovers
- **Persistence improvements**: custom `.state/` dir via `BOT_STATE_DIR`, log rotation for trade logs
