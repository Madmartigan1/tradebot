# Tradebot v1.0

üöÄ **First stable release (no longer beta)**

Tradebot is an automated crypto trading bot for **Coinbase Advanced**.  
It uses an **EMA crossover** strategy with **RSI/MACD advisors**, plus risk controls like daily caps, cooldowns, and optional stop-loss tolerance.

---

## ‚öì The Fleet Metaphor
To make the strategy easier to visualize:

- **EMA ‚Üí Captain**  
  The EMA crossover is the leader and core signal engine. When the short EMA crosses the long EMA, the Captain gives the order.

- **MACD ‚Üí Commodore**  
  The Commodore confirms momentum and trend direction. If the histogram disagrees, the Captain‚Äôs signal can be overridden.

- **RSI ‚Üí Skipper**  
  The Skipper keeps things safe in the short term. If RSI shows overbought/oversold, trades are vetoed even if the Captain/Commodore want action.

Together, they form a chain of command: **EMA (Captain)** gives orders, **MACD (Commodore)** ensures strategy aligns with trend, and **RSI (Skipper)** vetoes reckless moves.
