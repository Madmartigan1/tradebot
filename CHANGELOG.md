# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This format loosely follows *Keep a Changelog* and uses tags for versions.

## [v0.1.1-betaB] - 2025-09-17
### Added
- `bot/utils.py` centralizes state paths, JSON read/write, daily spend & cooldown tracking, and trade-log writing.

### Changed
- Maker-limit calculation moved into `TradeBot` and now uses live exchange increments per product; per-product bps offsets retained.
- Product set tweaks (AVAX replaces MATIC; SUI/CRO present).
- Config aligned with bot: `rsi_buy_floor` / `rsi_sell_ceiling` thresholds; removed duplicate `max_loss_bps`.

### Improved
- Startup fills reconciliation de-dupes; immediate fills after live orders update positions/P&L and log fees/liquidity.
- Per-run P&L baseline and session footer logged on shutdown.

### Notes
- `APIkeys.env.example` unchanged; real `APIkeys.env` remains local-only.
- Some duplication remains in `orders.py` / `constants.py` / `persistence.py` (to be consolidated later).

## [v0.1.0-betaA] - 2025-09-17
### Added
- EMA crossover signal engine with per-product EMA overrides.
- RSI & MACD “advisor” veto gates (overbought/oversold + momentum).
- Maker-prefer (post-only) limit orders with per-asset basis-point offsets.
- Daily USD spend cap and per-product cooldown enforcement.
- Dry-run mode (no live orders) as the default.
- Fills reconciliation on startup to align local P&L with Coinbase.
- Session footer with P&L + runtime; state persisted under `.state/`.
- Config-driven products & risk parameters in `bot/config.py`.
- `APIkeys.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `USAGE.md`, `requirements.txt`.

### Known limitations (beta)
- Some duplication across `tradebot.py`, `constants.py`, `orders.py`, and `persistence.py`.
- `strategy.py` not fully wired; thresholds are defined in `tradebot.py`.
- No unit tests yet for rounding/advisors/P&L accounting.
- Signals are tick-based; a candle-based strategy is planned for a future version.
